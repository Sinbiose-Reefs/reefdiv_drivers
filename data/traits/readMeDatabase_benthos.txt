We selected six traits within biological (maximum body size, growth form, trophic category,
modularity, and, mobility) and life-history category (reproduction type) considered with
ecological importance (Wahl, 2009). We based our classification scheme on previous
categorization for benthic organisms (Littler & Littler, 1984; Steneck & Dethier, 1994; Bell &
Barnes, 2001; Bremner et al., 2006; Wahl, 2009; Costello et al., 2015), selecting traits with
ecological relevance for the studied communities (i.e., similar requirements of resources and/or
provide similar services) and that could be applied to most taxa. If trait information was lacking
in literature, we assumed the dominant trait from higher taxonomic levels.

Maximum body size
Body size is directly related to the use of space and abundance, and indirectly to longevity and
metabolic rates resource (Woodward et al., 2005). The maximum body size was divided in four
ordinal categories: S = <10 cm, M = 10-50 cm, L = 50-400 cm, and, XL = >400 cm. We selected
information about maximum horizontal body size from literature and/or help from specialists.
For unitary organisms we consider individual size but for colonial organisms we used the
maximum reported size for colony or modular aggregations.

Growth form
Benthic growth form is related to habitat complexity and resource use (Richardson et al., 2017).
Growth form was classified as five categories in order to be able to compare the whole
community. We divided it growth form in: E = encrusting, M = massive, B = bushy or with upward growth, F = filamentous, and, EF = encrusting/filamentous.

Trophic category
Trophic category is linked to competitiveness and food webs and nutrient cycling (Hillebrand,
2004; Wahl et al., 2011). Trophic category was characterized in six categories: A = autotroph, S
= suspension/filter feeder, G = grazer, C = carnivore, and, AC = autotroph/carnivore.

Modularity
Modularity is related to reproduction type and the ability to occupy the substrate (Wahl et al.,
2011). We divided modularity as: S = solitaries and M = modular.

Mobility
Mobility is an indicative of dispersal potential of organisms (Costello et al., 2015). We
categorized mobility as: S = sessile or M = mobile organism.

Reproduction type
Life-history traits can describe the persistence and/or longevity of individual or populations over
time. To distinguish species sexual and asexual reproduction is easily available for most taxa and
can indicate the ability of a specie to disperse or recover from a disturb (Costello et al., 2015).
We classified reproduction type as: S = sexual, A = asexual, and, AS = asexual/sexual
