# reefdiv_drivers

Repository of the project "PATTERNS AND DRIVERS OF REEF DIVERSITY IN THE BRAZILIAN COAST".
We will explore spatial variation on reef community parameters, such as richness, functional diversity, and perhaps phylogenetic diversity. Also, we will analyze the influence of environmental drivers on such spatial variation.
