# reefdiv_drivers

Repository for the project ""Reef diversity patterns and drivers in the Brazilian Coast".
We will explore spatial variation on reef community parameters, such as richness, functional diversity, and perhaps phylogenetic diversity. Also, we will analyze the influence of environmental drivers on such spatial variation.
